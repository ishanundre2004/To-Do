# ToDo

This is my first flutter application. This "ToDo" app have features like :
1. Adding a new task using dialog box.
2. It allows user to add a line through your completed tasks.
3. If an user wants to delete the completed task, sliding the particular task from right will show the delete option
4. In this I have used Hive Database to store and perform operations on the tasks.
