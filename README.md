# todo

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

This is my first flutter application. This "ToDo" app have features like :
1. Adding a new task using dialog box.
2. It allows user to add a line through your completed tasks.
3. If an user wants to delete the completed task, sliding the particular task from right will show the delete option
4. In this I have used Hive Database to store and perform operations on the tasks.
